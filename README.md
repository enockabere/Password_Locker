##  Password Locker

### Description
On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.

We will create an amazing application that will help us manage our passwords and even generate new passwords for us.

### Behavior Driven Development
Users are required to create an account after which they can successfully log into the application. Upon successful login, they can:

- Create new credentials.
    Here users are required to provide an application name, their username for the account they have/wish to have on the said application and a password they use/would like to use for the said account. Users are also provided with the option of a generated password of which they are further allowed to select the length they desire for the password.
- Find credentials.
    Here, users can find credentials of a specific application by providing the application's name.
- Delete a credential.
    Here, users can delete credentials they don't need anymore.
- See all credentials.
    Here, the user is able to view all their saved credentials at once.
- Users can also delete an active account.
